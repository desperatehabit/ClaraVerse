Project Plan: Integrating Task Management & Real-time Voice into ClaraVerse
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines a strategic plan to integrate two major features into the ClaraVerse application:

An AI-Powered Personal Task System, inspired by the functionality and user experience of DoneTick.

A Real-time Voice Interaction System, leveraging the LiveKit Agents framework.

The successful implementation of these features will position ClaraVerse as a comprehensive, local-first productivity hub, where users can manage their tasks and interact with their AI assistant seamlessly through voice.

2. Guiding Principles
To ensure successful integration, all development will adhere to the following principles:

Maintain Local-First Philosophy: All user data, especially tasks, must be stored locally by default. Any cloud integration should be strictly optional and explicit.

Leverage Existing AI Core: The new features should deeply integrate with ClaraVerse's core AI (Llama.cpp). The goal is for the AI to actively assist in task management and to be the conversational partner in the voice system.

Modular Architecture: Each new feature will be developed as a distinct module to ensure maintainability and prevent tight coupling with the existing codebase.

Seamless User Experience (UX): The new features should feel like a natural extension of the existing ClaraVerse UI, not separate applications bolted on.

3. Comprehensive Feature Deep Dive: The Personal Productivity Hub
This section provides a detailed overview of the personal task system to clarify its scope and purpose, especially in contrast to existing agent-based tasking within ClaraVerse.

3.1. What is the Personal Task System?
This feature is a comprehensive, human-centric task and project management suite built directly into ClaraVerse. Inspired by the user-focused design of systems like DoneTick, it provides a dedicated space for users to organize their personal and professional lives. The core idea is to manage the user's to-do list, not the AI's.

3.2. How Is It Used?
Users will interact with the system in two primary ways:

Manual Management: Through a dedicated "Tasks" or "Productivity" section in the UI, users can manually create projects, add tasks, set due dates and priorities, write detailed notes, and organize items via drag-and-drop.

AI-Assisted Management: Users can leverage the Clara AI to manage tasks frictionlessly. By typing or speaking natural language commands (e.g., "Clara, remind me to pick up milk on my way home" or "Create a project for the Q4 marketing plan"), users can capture tasks without breaking their workflow.

3.3. What Data Will It Contain?
The system is built around a clear hierarchy of user-generated data:

Projects: High-level containers for tasks (e.g., "Website Redesign," "Vacation Planning"). Each project can have a name and a color for easy identification.

Tasks: The fundamental "to-do" items. Each task will contain:

content: The task title.

description: A rich text area for detailed notes and context.

due_date: An optional deadline.

priority: A level such as Low, Medium, High, or Urgent.

status: The current state (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed).

subtasks: A checklist of smaller items to complete the main task.

Tags: Flexible labels for categorizing tasks across different projects (e.g., #email, #urgent, #research).

3.4. Purpose for the End-User
The purpose of this system is to transform ClaraVerse into a true all-in-one productivity hub. It gives users a single, private, and intelligent platform to:

Centralize Organization: Consolidate personal to-do lists, work assignments, and long-term projects in one place.

Capture Effortlessly: Instantly capture thoughts and tasks as they arise during conversations with the AI or other work, reducing mental overhead.

Gain Clarity: Organize complex projects by breaking them down into manageable tasks and subtasks, with AI assistance.

3.5. Distinction From Existing AI Agent Tasks
This is a critical distinction. The existing task components in ClaraVerse are designed for AI agents and automation. This new system is designed for the human user.

AI Agent Tasks (Existing): Machine-centric commands that the AI executes autonomously. Example: "Summarize the attached PDF," "Generate an image of a sunset," "Run the 'daily-report' workflow." Here, the AI is the one doing the task.

Personal Tasks (New): Human-centric to-dos that the user is responsible for completing. Example: "Follow up with John about the invoice," "Buy groceries after work," "Prepare slides for the board meeting." Here, the AI's role is to help manage the task for the user, not to execute it.

4. Feature 1: AI-Powered Personal Task System - Implementation
This system will provide robust task management capabilities, with the AI acting as a smart assistant throughout the process.

Phase 1: Core Task Management - Backend & Storage
Database Selection:

Recommendation: Use SQLite. It's a file-based, serverless database perfect for a local-first Electron application. The better-sqlite3 Node.js package is highly performant and can be run directly from Electron's main process.

Data Schema Definition:

projects: (id, name, color, created_at)

tasks: (id, project_id, content, description, due_date, priority, status, is_completed, created_at, parent_task_id)

tags: (id, name)

task_tags: (task_id, tag_id)

API Layer (Electron IPC):

Create a set of API handlers in the Electron main process to manage database operations (CRUD for tasks, projects, etc.).

Use Electron's ipcMain and ipcRenderer to create a secure bridge for the React frontend to communicate with the database layer.

Phase 2: Frontend UI Development (React)
New Application Section:

Add a new "Tasks" or "Productivity" icon to the main navigation bar in the ClaraVerse UI.

Component Development:

ProjectList: A sidebar component to display and manage projects.

TaskList: Displays tasks for the selected project, with filtering and sorting options.

TaskItem: A single task component showing title, due date, priority.

TaskDetailView: A modal or side panel that appears when a task is clicked, showing all details, subtasks, notes, etc.

CreateTaskForm: A quick-add form that is always easily accessible.

Phase 3: AI Integration
Natural Language Task Creation:

Mechanism: When a user's chat input is identified as a command to create a task, the text is sent to the local Llama.cpp model with a specific prompt to extract entities like content, due_date, and priority into a JSON object.

AI-Assisted Task Breakdown:

A "Break Down with AI" button in the TaskDetailView will send the task title to the LLM, asking it to generate a list of logical subtasks which can then be added automatically.

5. Comprehensive Feature Deep Dive: The Real-time Conversational Hub
This section defines the real-time voice feature as a distinct mode of interaction, designed to exist alongside the current text-based chat system without disrupting it.

5.1. What is the Real-time Conversational Hub?
This is a new, voice-first interface dedicated to low-latency, real-time conversations with the Clara AI. It is not simply a "voice-to-text" feature for the existing chat window. Instead, it's a separate, synchronous communication channel that mimics a natural, spoken conversation. This hub will have its own UI, optimized for hands-free interaction.

5.2. How Is It Used?
A user will explicitly enter this "voice mode." This could be through a dedicated button in the main navigation or a global hotkey. Upon activation, the UI will shift to a new screen or overlay. This interface will provide clear visual cues for the AI's state: listening, thinking, or speaking. The conversation is a continuous stream of audio, with a live-updating transcript shown on screen for reference.

5.3. Purpose for the End-User
The goal is to provide a more fluid, natural, and accessible way to interact with the AI for specific use cases:

Hands-Free Operation: Allows users to interact with Clara while multitasking.

Brainstorming & Ideation: Facilitates a natural back-and-forth flow of ideas that can be cumbersome with text.

Accessibility: Provides a primary mode of interaction for users who may find typing difficult.

Speed: Enables quick queries and commands without the need to type.

5.4. Distinction From Existing Text Chat
This new hub is designed to be a parallel system, not a replacement. Each has distinct strengths:

Existing Text Chat (Asynchronous):

Medium: Text-based.

Interaction: User types a message, sends it, and waits for a full text response. It's turn-based and asynchronous.

Best For: Precise commands, sending code snippets, reviewing conversation history, and detailed, long-form responses.

Real-time Hub (Synchronous):

Medium: Voice-first.

Interaction: A continuous, low-latency audio stream. The user can interrupt the AI, and vice-versa, just like a real conversation.

Best For: Quick questions, brainstorming, dictation, and hands-free control. The transcript is a secondary artifact, not the primary medium.

This two-system approach ensures that existing text-based workflows and agent interactions remain stable and unaffected while introducing a powerful new mode of interaction.

6. Feature 2: Real-time Voice Communication - Implementation
This feature will enable users to speak directly with the Clara AI agent within the new Conversational Hub.

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (LiveKit Agents)
LiveKit Agent Server:

The LiveKit Agents framework requires a server-side component to run the agent logic. This can be a simple Python or Node.js server.

Integration: This server will be started as a child process by the Electron main process when the user first activates the voice feature, ensuring it runs locally.

STT/TTS Service Integration:

The LiveKit Agent needs Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) services.

Local-First Approach: To align with ClaraVerse's philosophy, integrate with local models.

STT: Use a local implementation of Whisper, such as whisper.cpp. The agent server can call this tool to transcribe audio.

TTS: Use a high-quality local TTS engine like Piper.

Cloud Fallback (Optional): Offer optional integration with cloud services like Deepgram (STT) and ElevenLabs (TTS) for users who want higher performance and have an internet connection.

Phase 2: Frontend UI Development (React)
New Application View ("Voice Mode"):

Design and build a new, dedicated screen or modal overlay for the real-time conversation. This view will be distinct from the current chat interface.

UI Components:

Visual Feedback: A central element (e.g., an orb or waveform) that animates to show if the AI is listening, processing, or speaking.

Live Transcript: A simple, auto-scrolling area to display the real-time transcription of the conversation.

Session Controls: Clear buttons to start, stop, or mute the session.

LiveKit Client SDK Integration:

Integrate the livekit-client JavaScript SDK into this new view to manage the connection and audio streams.

Phase 3: The Agent Workflow
User activates "Voice Mode."

The React frontend mounts the new Conversational Hub view and connects to the local LiveKit server, joining a specific room.

The Electron app ensures the Python/Node.js LiveKit Agent is running and also connects it to the same room.

The user speaks. The audio is streamed to the LiveKit Agent.

The Agent uses the local Whisper (STT) model to transcribe the audio into text.

The transcribed text is then passed to the Clara Core AI (Llama.cpp) for processing, just like text input.

The AI's text response is received by the Agent.

The Agent sends this text to the local Piper (TTS) engine to synthesize speech.

The synthesized audio is streamed back to the user through LiveKit as an audio track.

7. Phased Rollout & Roadmap
This project should be tackled in manageable milestones.

Milestone 1 (Task System MVP):

Implement the SQLite backend and IPC bridge.

Build the core React UI for manually creating, viewing, and completing tasks.

Goal: A functional, local-only task manager.

Milestone 2 (AI in Tasks):

Integrate natural language task creation from the chat interface.

Add the "AI-Assisted Task Breakdown" feature.

Goal: AI enhances the task management experience.

Milestone 3 (Voice System MVP):

Set up the local LiveKit Agent server and integrate local STT/TTS models.

Build the dedicated "Voice Mode" UI.

Connect the UI to the LiveKit server to establish a working audio pipeline (e.g., an "echo" test).

Goal: The real-time audio infrastructure and its dedicated UI are working end-to-end, separate from the text chat.

Milestone 4 (Full Integration):

Connect the LiveKit Agent to the Clara Core AI.

Refine the UX within the "Voice Mode" to make the conversation feel fluid and natural.

Goal: Users can have full, meaningful conversations with the Clara agent.

8. Potential Challenges & Mitigations
Performance of Local Models: Running STT, TTS, and an LLM locally can be resource-intensive.

Mitigation: Provide clear settings for users to select model sizes and enable/disable features based on their hardware.

Complexity: Managing multiple concurrent processes (Electron, React, Agent Server, AI models) is complex.

Mitigation: Use robust process management libraries and establish clear communication protocols between them.

Dependency Management: Adding significant new dependencies requires careful management.

Mitigation: Document setup steps clearly and, where possible, script the installation of required models and tools.
