## Legacy TypeScript Implementation (üìö Reference)

### Previous Architecture (Superseded by Python)
- [x] **Original LiveKit Agent** (`electron/services/voice/ClaraVoiceAgent.ts`) - TypeScript implementation
- [x] **WebRTC Audio Pipeline** (`src/features/voice/services/ClaraWebRTCService.ts`) - Audio streaming
- [x] **Voice Command Service** (`src/services/voice/VoiceCommandService.ts`) - Command processing
- [x] **Task Integration** (`src/services/VoiceTaskProcessor.ts`) - Task management
- [x] **UI Components** - Voice settings and visualization components

**Note**: The TypeScript implementation is preserved as reference but superseded by the Python architecture for better provider support and performance.
