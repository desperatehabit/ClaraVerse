[EPIC 1 - Step 1 - Environment Setup and Dependency Analysis]
1. Primary Task:
   - Prepare the project codebase to support the new personal task management feature by installing and configuring all necessary dependencies, primarily for SQLite database interaction and schema migrations. This foundational step ensures all tools are in place before database logic is written. (Source: project_planv2.md, Section 7.1)

2. File Locations:
   - To be Modified:
     - package.json: To add new dependencies.
- To be Created (Inferred Structure):
- electron/database/: A new directory to hold all database-related files.
- electron/database/migrations/: A new directory for SQL migration files.
- electron/database/database.json: A new configuration file for the migration tool.
- electron/preload.cjs: To expose the new IPC API to the renderer process.

3. UI/Component Specification:
   - Not applicable. This step involves no UI changes.

4. State Management Logic:
   - Not applicable. No new state management providers are required for this step.

5. Data Model & Schema:
   - This step prepares the environment for the future implementation of the database schema. The specific schema to be implemented in a later step is detailed in project_planv2.md, Section 4.1.

6. Backend Interaction Logic:
   - No backend interaction logic is to be written in this step. The goal is to install the necessary libraries that will enable future interactions with the local SQLite database.

7. Relevant Documentation & Examples:
   - Dependency Installation: The project will use better-sqlite3 for synchronous and efficient SQLite access in the Electron main process, and db-migrate with db-migrate-sqlite3 for handling schema migrations. (Source: project_planv2.md, Sections 4.1, 5.1)
     - Command:
       bash        npm install better-sqlite3        npm install db-migrate db-migrate-sqlite3 --save-dev        
- Migration Configuration (database.json):
- Create the electron/database/database.json file to configure the db-migrate tool.
json        {          "dev": {            "driver": "sqlite3",            "filename": "./clara_tasks.db"          }        }
- Add migration scripts to package.json:
json "scripts": { "db:migrate": "db-migrate up", "db:migrate:down": "db-migrate down", "db:migrate:create": "db-migrate create" } 

8. Error Handling:
   - Native Dependency Installation Failure: The installation of better-sqlite3 may fail if the necessary build tools (like node-gyp, Python, a C++ compiler) are not present on the development machine. The error message will typically indicate a compilation failure.
     - User-Facing Message (for developer): "Failed to install better-sqlite3. Please ensure you have the required build tools installed for your operating system (Python, C++ compiler, etc.) and try again."
- Configuration Errors: If database.json is missing or malformed, db-migrate commands will fail.
- User-Facing Message (for developer): "Database migration tool is not configured correctly. Please ensure electron/database/database.json exists and is valid."

9. Coding Standards & Verification:
- Adhere to the project's existing coding conventions for file structure and naming.
- Verification Checklist:
- 1. The dependencies better-sqlite3, db-migrate, and db-migrate-sqlite3 are successfully added to package.json.
- 2. npm install completes without any errors.
- 3. The electron/database/ and electron/database/migrations/ directories are created.
     - 4. The db-migrate configuration file (database.json) is created and correctly configured.
- 5. The migration scripts are added to package.json and are executable.
