[EPIC 2 - Step 9 - Final Testing & MVP Hardening]
1. Primary Task:
   - Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire Voice MVP feature set. This involves systematically testing all functionality under various conditions, fixing remaining bugs, and ensuring the feature is stable enough for user acceptance testing. (Source: project_planv2.md, Section 7.1)

2. File Locations:
   - To be Modified:
     - Any files within the personal task and voice features that have bugs discovered during testing. This step is about refinement, not new features.
   - To be Created:
     - e2e/tests/voice_feature.spec.ts (Inferred): A new end-to-end test file using a framework like Playwright or Cypress to automate testing of the voice UI.

3. UI/Component Specification:
   - No new components. This step focuses on polishing the existing UI. This includes:
     - Ensuring all buttons have clear loading and disabled states.
     - Making sure error messages are user-friendly and displayed correctly.
     - Checking for consistent styling and layout across the feature.

4. State Management Logic:
   - The focus will be on ensuring state is always cleaned up correctly. For example, making sure the voiceStore is fully reset to its initial state after a user disconnects or a connection fails permanently.

5. Data Model & Schema:
   - No changes to the data model.

6. Backend Interaction Logic:
   - This step involves testing all existing backend logic under stress and edge cases. For example:
     - What happens if the client sends audio before the agent has fully initialized the session?
     - What happens if the AI returns unexpectedly formatted JSON?
     - Does the deleteProject transaction correctly roll back if an error occurs midway?

7. Relevant Documentation & Examples:
   - End-to-End Test Plan (Conceptual):
     1.  Golden Path Test:
       - Navigate to the voice page.
       - Click "Start Session". Grant permissions.
       - Say "Create a task to test the final MVP".
       - Verify the transcript updates correctly.
       - Verify the audio response is heard.
       - Navigate to the tasks page and verify the task exists.
       - Click "End Session".
     2.  Reconnection Test:
       - Start a session.
       - Disconnect network, wait, reconnect network.
       - Verify the session recovers.
     3.  Error Condition Tests:
       - Deny microphone permission and verify the UI shows the correct error.
       - Test with backend services (AI, STT, TTS) disabled and verify fallback behavior.

8. Error Handling:
   - The goal of this step is to find and fix unhandled errors. All try...catch blocks should be reviewed to ensure they log meaningful errors and result in a predictable UI state. All potential null or undefined values should be handled gracefully.

9. Coding Standards & Verification:
   - This entire step is verification.
   - Verification Checklist (User Acceptance Criteria):
     - 1. A user can start, use, and end a voice session without any crashes or freezes.
     - 2. Voice commands for task creation work reliably.
     - 3. The conversation transcript is accurate and easy to read.
     - 4. The system can survive a brief network disconnect and recover.
     - 5. The UI provides clear, understandable feedback for all states (connecting, connected, reconnecting, failed, error).
     - 6. The server-side agent cleans up all session resources correctly after a participant leaves or a connection fails permanently.
     - 7. The application's overall performance is not negatively impacted by the voice feature running in the background.
